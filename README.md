Purpose.  More study of machine learning using unsupervised algorithms, which help us explore data when we're not sure what we're looking for.  K-means algorithm, elbow curve, PCA to limit features.
We worked on these points
Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples of each.
Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.
